## Fleetr

A pseudo-random fleet builder for Star Wars Armada that only contains ships, squadrons and named squadrons (i.e. no upgrade cards).

Intended for new players who don't yet know how to build their own fleets, or for quickly setting up a casual game.

Intended features:

* Add in what expansions you have and how many, and it builds a fleet from the list of ships contained.
* Will be able to set total fleet point value.
* Can add weights to the ships vs squadrons ratio (i.e. 65% chance of choosing a ship over a squadron)
